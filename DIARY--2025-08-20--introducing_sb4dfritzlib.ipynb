    "# Introducing `sb4dfritzlib`\n",
    "\n",
    "I invested some time to understand how to communicate with AVM FRITZ!Box routers using the [official APIs](https://fritz.com/service/schnittstellen/). As a result, I have written my own library `sb4dfritzlib` that will eventually remove the dependency of `sb4dfritz` from the `fritzconnection` library. Not that there's anything wrong with the latter, I just wanted to know how to do it myself so that I know exactly what's going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another motivating factor was the faint hope to get more accurate \"real time\" power measurements from energy sensors, or at least a better understanding what causes the limitations that I encountered. Recall that `fritzconnection` returns timestamps with second precision, leaving it unclear whether they were obtained by truncating or rounding. While I had little doubt that AVM is the root of this imprecision, I couldn't rule out the data processing `fritzconnection` as a cause. I can now definitively say that `fritzconnection` simply converts the XML data returned by the FRITZ!Box to appropriate Python data types. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, here's a summary of what I did:\n",
    "* I implemented the [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP)-based TR-064 interface (see `sb4dfritzlib.connection`).\n",
    "* I implemented the simpler AHA-HTTP interface and the required login procedure (see `sb4dfritzlib.connection`).\n",
    "* I implemented various utilities for data conversion (see `sb4dfritzlib.utilities`).\n",
    "* The core functionality is implemented in `sb4dfritzlib.homeauto` which provides classes `HomeAutoSystem` and `HomeAutoDevice` for object-based interaction with home automation devices."

    "\n",
    "* Request normally take around 0.75 to 0.8 seconds, occasionally a little longer.\n",
    "* The timestamp jumps 10 second interval. This means that power is measured only every 10 seconds. It also means that the **data requests *do not* trigger a measurements!** Measurements are taken periodically at times unrelated to the requests.\n",
    "* On repeated requests, the latency does not exceed 10 seconds by much. This indicates some undocumented \"sleep mode\" which reduces the update frequency in longer time stretches without data requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in real time information, this is bad news. A random request will give you a power value recorded some time in the last ~12.5 seconds, if you're lucky. Again, I would not consider this as \"real time\". After a little thought, you should realize that,  given the network latency (reflected in the request duration) and the second presicion in the timestamp, it's impossible to determine the time of measurement precisely from the provided data. There is always going to be some latency, and in bad cases you cannot expect to do better than ~2 seconds of latency. \n",
