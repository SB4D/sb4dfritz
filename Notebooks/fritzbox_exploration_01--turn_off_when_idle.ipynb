    "# Turn Off Fritz!DECT Smart Switch Only When Devices Are Idle\n",
    "\n",
    "I had a rather specific problem. The TL;DR version is that I have a smart switch controling an appliance which irregularly draws power without giving a clear indication. I'm a little paranoid and I prefer to turn off the switch only when the appliance is idle. The smart switch provides real time (well, almost...) power measurements and I used to manually check the power read out manufacturers app and wait for an idle state to turn of the machine. The goal was to automate this somewhat tedious procedure with a Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the full story. The appliance is my dual boiler espresso machine which takes about 20 minutes to heat up before use and, when running, has irregular heating periods to keep the boilers at operating temperature. During the heating periods the machine draws several hundreds of Watts of power up to about 1.4 kH, when idle the power consumption is about 3 W. The initial heating period is about 10-15 minutes long while the other periods are sometimes less than a minute. There is no visual indication for heating activity and the heating is mostly inaudible as well. Due to the long initial heating period I have the machine control by a Fritz!DECT 200 smart switch connected to my Fritz!Box router so that I can turn on the machine automatically in the morning so that it's ready to go when I get up. In this setup the smart switch completely replaces the machine's actual on/off switch which is constantly set to 'on'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I'm not an electrician but I certified service technician has assured me of two things:\n",
    "1. The smart switch has pretty much the same effect as the actual on/off switch.\n",
    "2. Switching off the machine during heating does not harm the machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, I feel better when the smart switch only goes to 'off' when the machine is idle."

    "\n",
    "The Fritz!Box allows third party interaction with the device. The official documentation is available in German on the manufacturer's homepage (https://fritz.com/service/schnittstellen/). Luckily, there is a Python library called `fritzconnection` which simplifies the process. In particular, the relevant functions for Fritz!DECT smart switches are:\n",
    "1. Retrieving the power measurements.\n",
    "2. Setting the switch state.\n",

    "## A problem for the implementation: latency\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the goal is to write a function, say `turnOffWhenIdle(...)`, that does what the name suggests. At first, the solution seems obvious. Simply connect to the Fritz!Box, monitor the power of the smart switch, wait until an idle value is reported, and only then turn off the switch. This would be easy using `firtzconnection` if the smart switch actually provided real time measurements as the manufacturer claims. However, a little expirementation suggests that this isn't quite the case. As far as I can tell, the following is true:\n",
    "* Power measurements are only recorded every 10 seconds.\n",
    "* The time stamp of the measurement only has second precision. The actual time of measurement is truncated.\n",
    "* Requesting and receiving the power measurements takes somewhere between 0.7 and 1 seconds. I'm assuming that it takes about half of this time for the request to reach the smart switch.\n",
    "* The first request after longer periods without requests is not always reliable. This is indicated by an outdated timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this complicates the design of an optimal `turnOffWhenIdle(...)` function:\n",
    "* Several requests of power data are necessary to obtain reliable values. It can take more than 10 seconds after an initial request until the data is reliable.\n",
    "* Even in the case, the read out is accurate, the latency between the measurement and retrieving the information can be over 12 seconds in the worst case.\n",
    "* Even in the best case, some latency has to be expected because the measuring cycle is not known precisely and it is next to impossible to set up a completely synchronized request cycle due to fluctuating request durations.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this understood the main task is to set up a request cycle using `fritzconnection` that is reasonably accurately synchronized with the power measurement cycle on the smart switch. "
